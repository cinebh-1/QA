# My QA portfolio
**About me** 👋
<br />
Hi, I'm Filip — a dedicated and aspiring Quality Assurance specialist. Since begining of 2025, I've been actively studying and practicing QA through a combination of structured courses and self-directed learning. What drew me to this field is the challenge and satisfaction of ensuring software functions as intended. I believe that thorough testing not only improves product reliability but also makes the digital world more accessible and user-friendly for everyone. This portfolio is a reflection of my journey so far. It includes collections of manual test cases as well as early samples of automated testing, which I'm currently focusing on to deepen my skills in test automation. I'm committed to continuous growth in the QA field and I'm excited to share what I've learned and what I'm still learning with the help of community. Will post more as time passes.

**My experience** 🏛️
<br />
Being in IT world for long enough I have gone through lot of stuff. When I stumbled into QA I knew that it was made for me. Through series of courses and self-learning for about 8 months I was immersed into the matter because of testing proceses and finding bugs. I have grown very fond of this role which motivates me to continue learning and growing. In addition my previous job responsibilities were providing general PC and network support for school I was working in (IT technician). Besides that working as IT teacher as well helped me learn lot of valueable soft skills as well.

# My QA portfolio
**About me** 👋
Hi, I'm Filip—a dedicated and aspiring Quality Assurance specialist. Since late 2024, I've been actively studying and practicing QA through a combination of structured courses and self-directed learning. What drew me to this field is the challenge and satisfaction of ensuring software functions as intended. I believe that thorough testing not only improves product reliability but also makes the digital world more accessible and user-friendly for everyone. This portfolio is a reflection of my journey so far. It includes collections of manual test cases as well as early samples of automated testing, which I'm currently focusing on to deepen my skills in test automation. I'm committed to continuous growth in the QA field and excited to share what I've learned—and what I'm still learning—with the community.
